# Day-5-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINE-CLASSIFIER
I have taken a challenge to make project on every algorithm of Machine Learning. [ Day-5 | Handwritten Digit Recognition using SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER]
 Overview
This project focuses on the recognition of handwritten digits using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The objective is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify digits (0-9) from handwritten images, using the popular MNIST dataset. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks due to its ability to find an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

Key Objectives
Preprocess and Prepare Data: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset for training.
Train a SVM Classifier: Build and train an SVM classifier to recognize handwritten digits.
Evaluate Model Performance: Measure the model's performance using accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
Predict New Data: Use the trained model to predict handwritten digits in unseen images.
